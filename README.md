Aurora
======

Aurora is a beautiful, dynamic art display. It's controllable, customizable, and extendable, allowing you to display your own animations and messages.

Aurora is driven by 1,024 bright RGB LEDS behind a diffusion screen. It's built using the [SmartMatrix SD Shield]
and a 32x32 RGB LED matrix.

Features
--------

* Procedural pattern viewer
* Animated GIF slideshow viewer
* Remote control, allowing for ease of use.
* Optional Clock display in the foreground, over animation and pattern slideshows (**requires real-time clock chip**).
